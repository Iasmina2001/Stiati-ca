The application is a general knowledge game, which I implemented in Greenfoot.
The game scenario takes place in space, where the player has the option to move in a virtual map and learn interesting information about outer space and celestial bodies. After going through the virtual map, the player helps an alien test his knowledge, going from a planet to another. The game ends, after answering correct to all questions.
